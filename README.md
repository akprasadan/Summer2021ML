# Summer2021ML
Implementations of basic ML algorithms in Python

In this repository, I store some 2021 Summer projects to upgrade my Python / data science skills. I will implement some machine learning algorithms (e.g. k-means) from scratch and also analyze some datasets. Ultimately, I want to create a framework to run many kinds of machine learning algorithms without repeating code for all the common functionalities (train/test splitting, tuning, evaluating, etc.).

- generalclassifier: Build an abstract framework to do machine learning using Object Oriented Programming. The goal will be to unify all of the below models into one library.
- k_means_project: Implement k-means clustering algorithm. Upcoming: Evaluation techniques, plotting functionality
- knn_classify_project: Implement the k-nearest neighbors classification algorithm. Both model training and evaluation is included. Upcoming: Plotting functionality.
